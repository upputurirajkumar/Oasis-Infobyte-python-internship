# Oasis-Infobyte-python-internship
This repository has the work I did while interning at Oasis Infobyte. The internship gave me practical experience in the development of several applications with the use of Python. Below are the details of the four tasks I completed: Below are the details of the four tasks I completed:

1. Voice Assistant
Created a Supervised-learning AI which has functionalities like opening programs, browsing, and giving details about the present climate. The assistant employs the conversion of speech-to-text and text-to-speech to communicate with the user.
Key Features:
The application of the speech_recognition library.
Reading with the core text-to-speech capability with the use of pyttsx3.
Web browser and other applications integration for task execution.

2. BMI Calculator
Developed a BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator application that accepts the height and weight of the user and then determines the BMI Scale. The application also gives the status of health depending on the calculation done on BMI.
Key Features:
Entered GUI to take input from the user using Tkinter.
Height and weight of the users for the calculation of the BMI is taken by the users themselves.
This paper defines the health status output based on BMI ranges.

3. Simple Password Generator
Used the Break the Web Challenge to build a Simple Password Generator to create a string of random, complex characters for users to use as passwords. The user is able to set how many characters and how difficult the password should be including the usage of letters, numbers, and symbols.
Key Features:
Input/output of the respective password length entered by the user.
Choices that can be made are to include letters as well as numbers and special characters.
Password creation using non-deterministic natural language with the objective of making the passwords as secure as possible.

5. Weather App
Created an Android weather app that sets its functionality to get and display the weather of a certain city. One of the key features of the application is that it takes use of an API to obtain the real-time previsions for the climate and put them into a comprehensible format.
Key Features:
Collection of the user input for the city name through, keyboard entry or voice recognition.
Utilizing weather API to get current weather conditions.
The show can take temperature, humidity, the current weather conditions and many other things.
